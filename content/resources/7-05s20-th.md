  caption: Would sugar by any other name taste as sweet? We learn in lecture 12 that
    the fructose in honey is a pyranose, whereas the fructose in corn syrup is a furanose,
    and one actually is sweeter. (Collage by MIT OpenCourseWare. Images by [Benjah-bmm27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose#/media/File:Beta-D-fructofuranose-from-xtal-view-1-3D-bs-17.png),
