  "course_description": "This course focuses on contributions of biochemistry toward an understanding of the structure and functioning of organisms, tissues, and cells. Topics include:\n\n*   Chemistry and functions of constituents of cells and tissues and the chemical and physical-chemical basis for the structures of nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates.\n*   Basic enzymology and biochemical reaction mechanisms involved in macromolecular synthesis and degradation, signaling, transport, and movement.\n*   General metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and nitrogen-containing materials such as amino acids, proteins, and related compounds.\n\nNOTE: The first half of this course, taught by Prof. Yaffe, is available on the MITx platform as _[7.05x Biochemistry: Biomolecules, Methods, and Mechanisms](https://www.edx.org/course/biochemistry-biomolecules-methods-and-mechanisms?utm_source=mitopenlearning-mit-open-learning&utm_medium=affiliate_partner)_. This OCW website provides content primarily from the second half with Prof. Vander Heiden, which focuses on metabolism.\n",
